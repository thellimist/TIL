Daily short summaries of what I learned that day.

## Logs
### Day 3: 27/01/2017
####1
UPS drivers try not to turn left. The reason is: 
- less accidents
- more predictable schedule meaning better time estamation.

####2
`Ekol`'s second meaning is `okul` at the same time in Turkish.

####3 What activity to do?
Do something that interests you. Most of the time it'd be better to do it with people. If the person is interested in science go to a science museum with that person. If the person is interested in German culture travel to Germany with that person. Try finding mutual interests and do that activity.

Mutual interest => more conversation about the activity => increase points in friendship
Doing something interesting => More fun, knowledge sticks more

### Day 2: 26/01/2017
####1
There is a country named Guyana in South America. Most private schools there employee American teachers.

### Day 1: 25/01/2017
#### Malaysia
Mahathir Mohamad is the most known prime minister of Malaysia. He did privatisations to increase the economy of Malaysia. Mahathir gave some of the privatisations to people who he know. He led to a lot of corruption at the same time. He followed the development model of East instead of West. Malaysian people like him where as Chinese Malaysian people don't like him as much. Mahathir made laws to enable easier corruption for higher ranked people. The current prime minister of Malaysia sucks and he is the successor of Mahathir.

After Communist Party in China the opposing party member mostly immigrated to Taiwan, some immigrated to Malaysia. After the Imperial Japan invasion to China a lot of Chinese people also immigrated to Malaysia. Currently ~25% of the population in Malaysia is Chinese. They speak mostly Mandarin but Cantonese is also spoken.

Do not call a Chinese Malaysian "Malay". It's like calling a black person white or vice-versa.

#### Mandarin vs Cantonese

Simplified Chinese created in 1949 based on Traditional Chinese.
