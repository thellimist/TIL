Daily short summaries of what I learned that day.

## Logs
### Day 6: 30/01/2017
Homer's Odyssey has 12000 lines and Qur'an has 6000 sentences. Both of them were memorized by people until they were written down. Homer's Odyssey was created ~800BC. 

#### Halbach array
Halbach array is a special arrangement of permanent magnets that augments the magnetic field on one side of the array while cancelling the field to near zero on the other side. It is used in refrigerator magnets to industrial applcaitions.

### Day 5: 29/01/2017
#### 5G
1G -> Phone  
2G -> Messaging (SMS)  
3G -> Internet  
4G -> Faster Internet  
5G -> Ultra Fast Internet  

5G has 5 compoenents which are new:  
1. Millimeter waves: Use shorter wave lengths which are not used by any mainstream devices.  
2. Small Cell: Since shorter wave lengths have problem passing through obstacals as a solution place lots of small cell stations which redirects the signal so it can pass through the object.   
3. Massive MIMO: Make the base cell station stronger. This has a negative effect of signals gettings cause serious interference.   
4. Beamforming: To fix MIMO instead of sending signals everywhere, it does some cool calculation to figure where the signal is coming from and only broadcast to that direction.  
5. Full Duplex: Signals are like trains. If multiple signals use the same frequency (rail) they'd iterfere. To fix this problem new switches are being developed which would reroute the signals to different frequencies for a short period of time to avoid the interference.  

### Day 4: 28/01/2017
Made a boardgame with Prisoners dilemma mechanic included. %60 of the time everybody lost.

### Day 3: 27/01/2017
UPS drivers try not to turn left. The reason is: 
- less accidents
- more predictable schedule meaning better time estamation.

`Ekol`'s second meaning is `okul` at the same time in Turkish.

#### What activity to do?
Do something that interests you. Most of the time it'd be better to do it with people. If the person is interested in science go to a science museum with that person. If the person is interested in German culture travel to Germany with that person. Try finding mutual interests and do that activity.  
Mutual interest => more conversation about the activity => increase points in friendship  
Doing something interesting => More fun, knowledge sticks more  

### Day 2: 26/01/2017
There is a country named Guyana in South America. Most private schools there employee American teachers.

### Day 1: 25/01/2017
#### Malaysia
Mahathir Mohamad is the most known prime minister of Malaysia. He did privatisations to increase the economy of Malaysia. Mahathir gave some of the privatisations to people who he know. He led to a lot of corruption at the same time. He followed the development model of East instead of West. Malaysian people like him where as Chinese Malaysian people don't like him as much. Mahathir made laws to enable easier corruption for higher ranked people. The current prime minister of Malaysia sucks and he is the successor of Mahathir.

After Communist Party in China the opposing party member mostly immigrated to Taiwan, some immigrated to Malaysia. After the Imperial Japan invasion to China a lot of Chinese people also immigrated to Malaysia. Currently ~25% of the population in Malaysia is Chinese. They speak mostly Mandarin but Cantonese is also spoken.

Do not call a Chinese Malaysian "Malay". It's like calling a black person white or vice-versa.

#### Mandarin vs Cantonese
Simplified Chinese created in 1949 based on Traditional Chinese.

| Countries | Language  | Text  |
| --------- | --------- | ----- |
| China     | Mandarin  | Simplified Chinese  |
| Singapore | Mandarin  | Simplified Chinese  |
| Taiwan    | Mandarin  | Traditional Chinese |
| Hong Kong | Cantonese | Traditional Chinese |
