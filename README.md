Word Count: 
- Japanese - 500,000
- Korean   - 500,000
- Dutch    - 400,000
- Chinese  - 370,000
- Russian  - 200,000
- English  - 171,476
- Spanish  - 100,000

Average native English speaker knows active vocabulary ~20,000 words and knows passive vocabulary ~40,000 words. Knowing 3000 words would have a coverage of 95%. This number is similar in Chinese.

### Day 6: 31/01/2017
#### Trimming Hair
In Ancient Egypt, Middle East and Turkey women shaving public parts of a norm. In Ancient Greek woman also shaved their public seen hair as well as their pubic hairs. In Rome mostly the upper class had this trend. This trend usually stuck. Queen Victoria trimmed her eyebrows. In 1915 the first armless sleeves ad was up and woman having hair on their armpits regarded as not so feminin. This trend escalated in USA. Skirts, shorter skirts, mini skirts forced woman to shave their legs in USA. With the Bikini Ads woman started to shave their pubic hairs. This trend still continues. Brazillian wax was the next generation of full body hairless trend and currently this trend dominates young girls.

#### Cool War Tactics
- In WW1 the allies became used to the smell of chemical weapons and would put their gas masks on quickly. The Germans changed their tactics and would use nearly odorless vomit-inducing chemicals that would absorb quickly into the lungs first. Then, once soldiers were vomiting and couldn't keep their gas masks on - they would fire the main artillery barrage containing the lethal chemicals.

- "How many mines does it take to make a minefield? One sign." The British pulled a dirty trick during the African campaign in WWII. At every well and oasis they could find they hung a sign that said "Danger! Poison!" In English and German. It was only when the Germans complained that poisoning wells was a warcrime that the British pointed out that yes, poisoning wells was a crime, but merely hanging signs was not. The water was perfectly drinkable.

- In Iranian-Iraq war while the Iranian troops were on Marsh land Iraq send thousands of volts to the land frying all the troops

- In WW2 almost all the bombs and sirens on it which made the opposite sides moral to decrease.

- Napoleon's advance guards, had captured a bridge over the Danube at Vienna by falsely claiming that an armistice had been signed, and then rushing the bridge while the guards were distracted

- Genghis Khan, in a large scale attack against the fortress at Volohai, after being unable to breach the walls demanded 1000 cats and 10,000 Chinese Swallows in exchange for lifting the siege. When the defenders sent out the animals Genghis took them and tied tufts of cotton to their tails and ignited them, at which point the animals rushed back to their homes within the city, igniting hundreds of small fires, while Genghis' army attacked again and took the fortress amidst the panic


### Day 6: 30/01/2017
Homer's Odyssey has 12000 lines and Qur'an has 6000 sentences. Both of them were memorized by people until they were written down. Homer's Odyssey was created ~800BC. 

#### Halbach array
Halbach array is a special arrangement of permanent magnets that augments the magnetic field on one side of the array while cancelling the field to near zero on the other side. It is used in refrigerator magnets to industrial applcaitions.

### Day 5: 29/01/2017
#### 5G
1G -> Phone  
2G -> Messaging (SMS)  
3G -> Internet  
4G -> Faster Internet  
5G -> Ultra Fast Internet  

5G has 5 compoenents which are new:  
1. Millimeter waves: Use shorter wave lengths which are not used by any mainstream devices.  
2. Small Cell: Since shorter wave lengths have problem passing through obstacals as a solution place lots of small cell stations which redirects the signal so it can pass through the object.   
3. Massive MIMO: Make the base cell station stronger. This has a negative effect of signals gettings cause serious interference.   
4. Beamforming: To fix MIMO instead of sending signals everywhere, it does some cool calculation to figure where the signal is coming from and only broadcast to that direction.  
5. Full Duplex: Signals are like trains. If multiple signals use the same frequency (rail) they'd iterfere. To fix this problem new switches are being developed which would reroute the signals to different frequencies for a short period of time to avoid the interference.  

### Day 4: 28/01/2017
Made a boardgame with Prisoners dilemma mechanic included. %60 of the time everybody lost.

### Day 3: 27/01/2017
UPS drivers try not to turn left. The reason is: 
- less accidents
- more predictable schedule meaning better time estamation.

`Ekol`'s second meaning is `okul` at the same time in Turkish.

#### What activity to do?
Do something that interests you. Most of the time it'd be better to do it with people. If the person is interested in science go to a science museum with that person. If the person is interested in German culture travel to Germany with that person. Try finding mutual interests and do that activity.  
Mutual interest => more conversation about the activity => increase points in friendship  
Doing something interesting => More fun, knowledge sticks more  

### Day 2: 26/01/2017
There is a country named Guyana in South America. Most private schools there employee American teachers.

### Day 1: 25/01/2017
#### Malaysia
Mahathir Mohamad is the most known prime minister of Malaysia. He did privatisations to increase the economy of Malaysia. Mahathir gave some of the privatisations to people who he know. He led to a lot of corruption at the same time. He followed the development model of East instead of West. Malaysian people like him where as Chinese Malaysian people don't like him as much. Mahathir made laws to enable easier corruption for higher ranked people. The current prime minister of Malaysia sucks and he is the successor of Mahathir.

After Communist Party in China the opposing party member mostly immigrated to Taiwan, some immigrated to Malaysia. After the Imperial Japan invasion to China a lot of Chinese people also immigrated to Malaysia. Currently ~25% of the population in Malaysia is Chinese. They speak mostly Mandarin but Cantonese is also spoken.

Do not call a Chinese Malaysian "Malay". It's like calling a black person white or vice-versa.

#### Mandarin vs Cantonese
Simplified Chinese created in 1949 based on Traditional Chinese.

| Countries | Language  | Text  |
| --------- | --------- | ----- |
| China     | Mandarin  | Simplified Chinese  |
| Singapore | Mandarin  | Simplified Chinese  |
| Taiwan    | Mandarin  | Traditional Chinese |
| Hong Kong | Cantonese | Traditional Chinese |
