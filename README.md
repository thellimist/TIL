### Day 18: 12/02/2017
#### Virus
There are 10^31 viruses in the oceans alones. There are viruses which can be beneficial for humans killing unwanted bacterias. What makes virus interesting is they don't have any metabolizm meaning they don't produce energy. They mimic other stuff to fool cells thinking it's something they need. Afterwards mostly by chance they find their way to the nucleus of the cell. They trick the nucleus to get in the pore. They trick the cell to think the genetic code of the virus belongs to a specific part of the organisms genetic code. The cell splices their genetic code and add the virus genetic code. Afterwards the cell is highjacked and the virus does whatever it is programmed for. Mostly the cell produces more viruses thinking it needs it. At some point the newly made viruses should leave the cell but since the viruses are most of the time too big to pass the membrane, the virus hacks the cell to cut the membrane resulting all of the viruses free and killing the cell. Cell dying is merely a side effect. Viruses can make the host to vomit, diarrhea etc. eventually killing it. Evolutionary killing the host does not benefit the virus but it has other benefits like faster reproduction etc. The process can differ in different types of viruses. This is a general explanation and an example of how it works.

Everything a virus does is by chance. There are enormous numbers of viruses and most of them are created faulty and fail. The whole concept of viruses is based on sheer number. 

Viruses can have latency meaning they can hide, doing nothing for years. Once they find their target they can infect. In cases like HIV they hide in cell, actually it is not known where they hide but basically somewhere where immune system can not find it. That is one of the reasons why HIV is so hard to cure. Currently there are medications to block HIV but not destory it.

Viruses can have single-strand DNA, single-strand RNA, double-strand DNA, double-strand RNA. 

To create a vaccination of a virus, the usualy method is heating up until some proteins deform but the genetic code does not or vice-versa. This way we can disable the virus some sense and allow the immune system to recognize it.

### Day 17: 11/02/2017
- House of Habsburg was the leader house of Holy Roman Empire. Later on they've became the leader of Austria-Hungary Empire  
- Vegitarians should take B12 additionally since they can not have enough naturally.
- Pasta originally comes from China 1100BC not Italians.

### Day 16: 10/02/2017
How ancient civilizations [sound](https://www.facebook.com/arkeolojidunyasiii/videos/1658383744188552/) like:  
(This is just an estimaton of how they sound. It probably is not how they truly speak)
- Ancient Egypt, Asyyrian has lots of unique Semetic sounds like 'H' and sounds from throat.
- Sumerians sounds like Arabic with harsh sounds but without the sounds from throat.
- Gokturks sounds like Turks today. 
- Hittites sounds like they are talking from their mouths. It resembles more like a European language.

Scrubs is the uniform doctors wear. The name of the tv series comes from there.


### Day 15: 9/02/2017
There is water on Moon. Mostly from asteriods and some guessed from Earth since Moon was split from Earth long time ago.

Scandanavia are Norway, Sweden, Denmark. Northdic countries are Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland

In oil economic crisis a German company TRUMPF did not lay workers. Instead they decreased the amount of time each worker had to work. Usually 3 days per week. That way they did not lose the talent and handled the crisis good enough.

### Day 14: 8/02/2017
Tagalog is Filipino. (There is a bit difference but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)

### Day 13: 7/02/2017
- To make vacination, one must grow a culture then heat it up. (killing the virus but the protein structure remaining the same)
- To make penicillin, just use the mold growing on top of food. It's the green ones on bread, cheese, oranges etc.
- The length of pendulum that takes one second to swing end-to-end is called a meter (simple way to measure it). It takes the same amount of time regardless how high you drop it.
- Zebra can mate with donkey or horse. Weird creatures appear afterwards.

Cities were really filty even in early 19th century. In 14th century London;
- people were throwing their poo in the streets. City started to fine them. A new job; waste collectors were introduced. People started to throw poo and waste to Thames river. That was also fined. People did it anyways.  
- butchers were breading/cutting animals in streets (amazing amount of filth produced). Goverment only allowed butchers to work in 3 open squares instead of the whole city. Dodgy butchers became more populer, city banned selling meat after dark.   
After plague losing half the population, city introced more fines (20,000£) for waste dumping, increased the amount of waste collectors. They still couldn't manage to make the city clean...  

### Day 12: 6/02/2017
Homo Sapiens started walking on two foot because in Savannah standing up meant less heat absorbed. This way sapiens could hunt/harvest at noon time where as other predators had to be in the shadows to stay cool.

McDonalds main business is not food, it is real estate.

In China woman who are not married until 27 are called "leftover" woman.

### Day 11: 5/02/2017 - Week 2

- Yugoslavia means "Land of the Southern Slavs".
- Salary derives fromt the latin word salarium which means salt-money. Salt used as a currency at some time periods.
- Buck comes from dear skin (buck skin) being used as a currency.
- Money comes from Moneta which is a Roman mint where moneys where made.

There was an experiment with monkeys where monkeys could trade 2 rocks for a banana, 1 rock for a grape. Basically rock was a currency for them. Some male monkeys gave rocks to female monkeys to have sex. Then the female monkeys would buy food with the money she earned. Animal Prostitution.

### Day 10: 4/02/2017
In cold weather if someone has nasal discharge, it may be because of the cold water molecules getting in the nostrils and getting out as water. It may not be because of being sick.

Random infos:
- There are no car roads from North America to South America.
- Australia has a 5500km long fence called Dingo Fence. Currently it's purposes is to keep wild dogs out of South East Australia.
- San José is the capital of Costa Rica. There is San Jose in California which is the same but written differently (é).
- Costa Rica allows drivers to drive only 6 days a week. The last digit of the plate indicates which day the car can not be used.
- Afghanistan is GMT +4:30, border to it China is GMT +8. 3:30 hour difference crossing the border.
- Crypus has two seperate UK land, single Greece and Turkey parts.


### Day 9: 3/02/2017
TIL What is [puff pastry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puff_pastry). I also learned how to cook pastry with spanich. Tip: don't use baking soda with it. It's useless.

### Day 8: 2/02/2017
- In Japanese, the country Japan is called Nihon
- The word Barbarian comes from ancient Greek. It means people who speak gibirish (not Greek nor Latin). 
- New Zealand comes from Zeeland (Sealand) which is a dutch territory. 

After iron is drawn from dead blood cells the left over material billurubin can either go to kidneys and give the yellow color or go to the intestine and bacteries there could give the brown color to our pee/feces.

TIL how to make origami owl. Wait? Does this belong here? Not sure w/e.

Pixar plays the same soundtrack over and over again in both happy and sad scenes. The soundtrack becomes their soundtrack in the viewers mind making them more emotionally effective. [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8HePfa7WYs)

Average native English speaker knows active vocabulary ~20,000 words and knows passive vocabulary ~40,000 words. Knowing 3000 words would have a coverage of 95%. This number is similar in Chinese.

### Day 6: 31/01/2017
#### Trimming Hair
In Ancient Egypt, Middle East and Turkey women shaving public parts of a norm. In Ancient Greek woman also shaved their public seen hair as well as their pubic hairs. In Rome mostly the upper class had this trend. This trend usually stuck. Queen Victoria trimmed her eyebrows. In 1915 the first armless sleeves ad was up and woman having hair on their armpits regarded as not so feminin. This trend escalated in USA. Skirts, shorter skirts, mini skirts forced woman to shave their legs in USA. With the Bikini Ads woman started to shave their pubic hairs. This trend still continues. Brazillian wax was the next generation of full body hairless trend and currently this trend dominates young girls.

#### Cool War Tactics
- In WW1 the allies became used to the smell of chemical weapons and would put their gas masks on quickly. The Germans changed their tactics and would use nearly odorless vomit-inducing chemicals that would absorb quickly into the lungs first. Then, once soldiers were vomiting and couldn't keep their gas masks on - they would fire the main artillery barrage containing the lethal chemicals.

- "How many mines does it take to make a minefield? One sign." The British pulled a dirty trick during the African campaign in WWII. At every well and oasis they could find they hung a sign that said "Danger! Poison!" In English and German. It was only when the Germans complained that poisoning wells was a warcrime that the British pointed out that yes, poisoning wells was a crime, but merely hanging signs was not. The water was perfectly drinkable.

- In Iranian-Iraq war while the Iranian troops were on Marsh land Iraq send thousands of volts to the land frying all the troops

- In WW2 almost all the bombs and sirens on it which made the opposite sides moral to decrease.

- Napoleon's advance guards, had captured a bridge over the Danube at Vienna by falsely claiming that an armistice had been signed, and then rushing the bridge while the guards were distracted

- Genghis Khan, in a large scale attack against the fortress at Volohai, after being unable to breach the walls demanded 1000 cats and 10,000 Chinese Swallows in exchange for lifting the siege. When the defenders sent out the animals Genghis took them and tied tufts of cotton to their tails and ignited them, at which point the animals rushed back to their homes within the city, igniting hundreds of small fires, while Genghis' army attacked again and took the fortress amidst the panic


### Day 6: 30/01/2017
Homer's Odyssey has 12000 lines and Qur'an has 6000 sentences. Both of them were memorized by people until they were written down. Homer's Odyssey was created ~800BC. 

#### Halbach array
Halbach array is a special arrangement of permanent magnets that augments the magnetic field on one side of the array while cancelling the field to near zero on the other side. It is used in refrigerator magnets to industrial applcaitions.

### Day 5: 29/01/2017 - Week 1 
#### 5G
1G -> Phone  
2G -> Messaging (SMS)  
3G -> Internet  
4G -> Faster Internet  
5G -> Ultra Fast Internet  

5G has 5 compoenents which are new:  
1. **Millimeter waves**: Use shorter wave lengths which are not used by any mainstream devices.  
2. **Small Cell**: Since shorter wave lengths have problem passing through obstacals as a solution place lots of small cell stations which redirects the signal so it can pass through the object.   
3. **Massive MIMO**: Make the base cell station stronger. This has a negative effect of signals gettings cause serious interference.   
4. **Beamforming**: To fix MIMO instead of sending signals everywhere, it does some cool calculation to figure where the signal is coming from and only broadcast to that direction.  
5. **Full Duplex**: Signals are like trains. If multiple signals use the same frequency (rail) they'd iterfere. To fix this problem new switches are being developed which would reroute the signals to different frequencies for a short period of time to avoid the interference.  

### Day 4: 28/01/2017
Made a boardgame with Prisoners dilemma mechanic included. %60 of the time everybody lost.

### Day 3: 27/01/2017
UPS drivers try not to turn left. The reason is: 
- less accidents
- more predictable schedule meaning better time estamation.

`Ekol`'s second meaning is `okul` at the same time in Turkish.

#### What activity to do?
Do something that interests you. Most of the time it'd be better to do it with people. If the person is interested in science go to a science museum with that person. If the person is interested in German culture travel to Germany with that person. Try finding mutual interests and do that activity.  
Mutual interest => more conversation about the activity => increase points in friendship  
Doing something interesting => More fun, knowledge sticks more  

### Day 2: 26/01/2017
There is a country named Guyana in South America. Most private schools there employee American teachers.

### Day 1: 25/01/2017
#### Malaysia
Mahathir Mohamad is the most known prime minister of Malaysia. He did privatisations to increase the economy of Malaysia. Mahathir gave some of the privatisations to people who he know. He led to a lot of corruption at the same time. He followed the development model of East instead of West. Malaysian people like him where as Chinese Malaysian people don't like him as much. Mahathir made laws to enable easier corruption for higher ranked people. The current prime minister of Malaysia sucks and he is the successor of Mahathir.

After Communist Party in China the opposing party member mostly immigrated to Taiwan, some immigrated to Malaysia. After the Imperial Japan invasion to China a lot of Chinese people also immigrated to Malaysia. Currently ~25% of the population in Malaysia is Chinese. They speak mostly Mandarin but Cantonese is also spoken.

Do not call a Chinese Malaysian "Malay". It's like calling a black person white or vice-versa.

#### Mandarin vs Cantonese
Simplified Chinese created in 1949 based on Traditional Chinese.

| Countries | Language  | Text  |
| --------- | --------- | ----- |
| China     | Mandarin  | Simplified Chinese  |
| Singapore | Mandarin  | Simplified Chinese  |
| Taiwan    | Mandarin  | Traditional Chinese |
| Hong Kong | Cantonese | Traditional Chinese |
